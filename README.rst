RoundRobin
==========

Another pure python wrapper for rrdtools.

rrdtool is used with a pipe, with pexpect_. or the subprocess tools.

Usage
-----

RRD has it own vocabulary. Even a wrapper can't learn it for you.
A least, you have to read this : http://oss.oetiker.ch/rrdtool/tut/rrdtutorial.en.html

And the python tests.
